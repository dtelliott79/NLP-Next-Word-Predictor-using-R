# Natural-Language-Processing-Next-Word-Predictor-using-R
R scripts that cleans a large volume of text, then uses the processed text to develop a model predicting the next word from the previous two words.

The final processed data, along with the final prediction model function, are combined into a GUI based Shiny Application, available at (https://dtelliott79.shinyapps.io/ShinyWordPredictor/).

More details, including some simple model performance metrics, can be found in the repository files, or at (http://rpubs.com/delliott79/256581).
